PSEUDOCODE:

main site displays 5 buttons

the buttons each correspond to their own library

there are 5 libraries - one for each group member's selections

each library contains a selection of movies.

when a button is clicked it directs the user to the next page which displays a
question and provides multiple choices.

when a choice is selected, the program will direct the user to the final page,
upon which they will find their recommended movie, a description of the movie,
and an image corresponding to the movie.


 title page -> fruit page -> final page(question + random movie suggestion)
